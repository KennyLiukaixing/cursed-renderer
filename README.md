# Welcome to Cursed Renderer!
This is my current side project of choice. As an aspiring computer graphics programmer and passionate 3D artist, I believed that it would be fun to create my very own ray-tracing engine. 
## What does it do?
Cursed-Renderer seeks to provide a direct, bloatless pipeline to the world of 3D graphics via Java multithreading. This offers many unique challenges and opportunities as this deviates away from traditional graphics programming conventions.
This choice is also because people have already made much better C++ implementations of the same thing and I need to win a bet that I can make a ray-tracer in Java.

## What doesn't it do?
Anything remotely useful, sorry.

That's it, thanks for checking it out!
